[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://alzheimer-caregiver-support-chatbot.streamlit.app/)

<span style="color:grey">This project implements a chatbot designed to support caregivers of Alzheimer's patients. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology, specifically the Llama3 model, caregivers can seek advice and information related to caregiving challenges. Streamlit: Used for building the web application UI. OpenAI GPT-3 (Llama3 model): Integrated for NLP tasks. Python 3: Programming language used for development.
- **Inspiration**: Alzheimer's Society's Walk Toronto 2024 event.

<span style="color:grey">In this project, I used various machine learning algorithms to predict car prices. After extensive analysis and testing, the XGBooster Regressor stood out as the best performer, even without any optimization. This repository contains the code and methodologies used in the project, along with detailed explanations of each step.</span>
